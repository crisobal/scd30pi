//! Library to communicate with the I2C SCD30 CO2, temperature and humidity sensor
//! made by Sensirion.
//!
//! Provides basic functionality according the [SCD30 Reference] from Sensirion.
//!
//!
//! The target platform is a Raspberry pi so either you compile it on an rpi or use crosscompiling.
//! It is based on Raspberry Pi Peripheral Access Library [RPPAL]. The
//! physical SCD30 connection to i2c can be done by wiring the device to the first i2c ports of the GPIO
//! connector.
//!
//!
//! Connect to RaspberryPi GPIO:
//! - pin 1 (3.3V/VCC)
//! - pin 3 (SDA)
//! - pin 5 (SCL)
//! - pin 6 (GND).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//!  ```
//! use scd30pi::i2c::SCD30;
//! use std::{thread, time};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut sensor = SCD30::new().unwrap();
//!     let speed = sensor.get_bus_speed().unwrap();
//!     println!("bus Speed: {}", speed);
//!
//!     sensor.start().unwrap();
//!     sensor.set_measure_interval(2).unwrap();
//!
//!     let version = sensor.read_firmware_version().unwrap();
//!     println!("Current firmware version {}", version);
//!
//!     while !sensor.data_available().unwrap() {
//!         thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_millis(200));
//!     }
//!
//!     let temperature = sensor.temperature().unwrap();
//!     let co2 = sensor.co2().unwrap();
//!     let humidity = sensor.humidity().unwrap();
//!
//!     println!(
//!         "co2 = {:.0} ppm, temp = {:.2} Â°C, humidity = {:.0} %",
//!         co2, temperature, humidity
//!     );
//! }
